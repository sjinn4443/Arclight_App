# Product Context

## Why this project exists

The Arclight project is an interactive educational platform designed to support clinical learning in ophthalmology and related fields. It aims to address the need for accessible and effective medical education for healthcare professionals and students, providing a practical, interactive platform to enhance diagnostic skills and knowledge, especially in resource-limited settings where traditional training materials might be scarce. The platform features clinical quizzes, interactive case studies, chatbot-driven guidance, and a multilingual, user-friendly interface.

## Problems it solves

- **Limited access to specialized medical training:** Provides a digital platform for learning that can be accessed anywhere.
- **Lack of interactive learning tools:** Offers quizzes, case studies, and interactive modules to make learning engaging.
- **Difficulty in visualizing medical conditions:** Utilizes a rich library of images and videos to demonstrate various conditions and procedures.
- **Need for offline learning:** The PWA capabilities ensure that content is available even without internet connectivity, crucial for remote areas.

## How it should work

The application should function as a self-contained educational resource. Users should be able to:
- Navigate easily between different modules (e.g., Anterior Segment Quiz, Cataract, Mires).
- Interact with quizzes and receive immediate feedback.
- View high-quality images and videos related to medical conditions.
- Access content offline after initial loading.

## User experience goals

- **Intuitive and easy to use:** The interface should be clean and straightforward, requiring minimal instruction.
- **Engaging and interactive:** Content should keep users interested and actively participating in their learning.
- **Reliable and performant:** The application should load quickly and function smoothly, even with large media files.
- **Educational and informative:** Content should be accurate, up-to-date, and clearly presented to maximize learning outcomes.
