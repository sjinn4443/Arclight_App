# Progress

## What Works

- **Core Application Structure:** The main `index.html` and module directories are in place.
- **Basic Navigation:** The application can navigate between the main page and individual module pages.
- **PWA Setup:** `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` are present, indicating initial PWA configuration.
- **Content Organization:** Images and videos are organized in dedicated directories.
- **Module-specific content:** Each module (e.g., AnteriorSegmentQuiz, Cataract) has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, suggesting self-contained functionality.

## What's Left to Build

- **Full Content Population:** Ensure all educational modules are fully populated with comprehensive content (text, images, videos, quizzes).
- **Interactive Elements:** Implement and refine all interactive elements within quizzes and case studies.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implement client-side error handling for a smoother user experience.
- **Accessibility Features:** Enhance accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.) across the application.
- **Testing:** While a comprehensive test suite is in place, continue to develop and expand automated tests for edge cases, error handling, and new features as they are developed. Keep tests in sync with the codebase.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize media loading and overall application performance.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Establish a clear deployment process for different environments (dev, test, prod).

## Current Status

The project is in its initial setup phase, with the foundational structure and core documentation being established. The basic framework for a PWA-enabled educational application is in place, and the next steps involve populating content and implementing detailed functionalities.

## Known Issues

- No specific known issues at this stage, as the focus has been on documentation and foundational setup. Potential issues may arise during content integration and feature development.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use a PWA-first approach was made early to ensure offline accessibility, which is crucial for the target audience.
- The modular design was chosen to facilitate parallel development and easier maintenance of distinct educational units.
- The preference for vanilla JavaScript aims to keep the project lightweight and reduce external dependencies.
